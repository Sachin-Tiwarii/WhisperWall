WhisperWall

A full-stack anonymous confession platform built using the MERN stack.

Users can post confessions anonymously, engage through likes and comments, and report inappropriate content — all without revealing their identity.

Overview

WhisperWall is designed to provide a safe and anonymous environment for users to share thoughts freely. The system ensures user privacy by never exposing personal details in the feed while still supporting full engagement features.
The application follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend and an Express/MongoDB backend.
